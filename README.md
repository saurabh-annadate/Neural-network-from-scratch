# ML-Project
In this project I have tried to make Neural networks to classify MNIST number dataset.
This was my term project for machine learning course, so mostly my codes are based on what my instructor expected them to be.

# Outline of the project
Neural network of zero hidden layer.
hidden layer which uses sigmoid function as activation function and softmax final layer
Network with 2 hidden layers
Neural Network with 2 hidden layers with choices for choosing activation function 1) tanh, 2) relu,3) sigmoid.
Implementing momentum with gradient descent and adding epochs for multiple iterations
