# Project Title

Recognize handwritten numbers in MNIST dataset using Neural Network

## Side note 
In this project I have tried to make Neural networks to classify MNIST number dataset.
This was my term project for machine learning course, so mostly my codes are based on what my instructor expected them to be.
### Prerequisites

```
I'll not cover how neural network works in backend, so you should know its working.
```
```
knowledge of Python (I've used iPython notebook but you can run this code on whatever you are comfortable with.
```
## Outline of the project
* Neural network of zero hidden layer.
* hidden layer which uses sigmoid function as activation function and softmax final layer
* Network with 2 hidden layers
* Neural Network with 2 hidden layers with choices for choosing activation function 1) tanh, 2) relu,3) sigmoid.
* Implementing momentum with gradient descent and adding epochs for multiple iterations
